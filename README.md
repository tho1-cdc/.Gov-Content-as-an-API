.Gov-Content-as-an-API
======================

Standards, Tools, and Guidance for offering web content and digital media throug a web service. This ecompasses media discovery mechanisms for searching and browsing, and methods to retrieve the embed code needed to embed a media item into a hosting site.  Includes tools for capturing view and click-through metrics from syndicated media and administrative tools to support Software as a Service (Saas) implementations for hosting multiple media storefronts against a single set of media syndication services.



### API Standards for Content APIs 
* [White House API Standards](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards) with a few extensions; specifically to allow for multiple messages in the return for buld operations and also an extension of the pagination mechanism.  These changes have been proposed as enhancements to the Whitehouse.gov specification on GitHub.
